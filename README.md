# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is designed to predict loan approval outcomes based on historical data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various features such as applicant income, credit score, loan amount, etc.

## Files

### 1. `main.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the source code for the project.
- **Content**: It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps. The notebook is structured to load the dataset, perform data cleaning, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

### 2. `LoanApprovalPrediction.csv`
- **Description**: This CSV file contains the entire dataset used for the project.
- **Content**: The dataset consists of several features (such as applicant income, credit score, loan amount, etc.) and the target variable (Loan Approval Status). The file is loaded and processed in the `main.ipynb` notebook for training and testing the predictive model.
